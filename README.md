# Moving Average Indicator

## Description
The Moving Average Indicator project is built using Python and utilizes the `yfinance`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` libraries. It generates buy and sell signals based on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. The logic for generating signals is as follows: when the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crosses above the 50-day EMA, a buy signal is generated, and when the 20-day EMA crosses below the 50-day EMA, a sell signal is generated. These signals are visually represented by green and red arrows, respectively, on the price chart.
